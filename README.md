Calculation of [average distance between NHL arenas](https://github.com/CaptainErable/Fun-Projects/blob/master/Average%20NHL%20City%20Distance.py) from their [GPS coordinates](https://github.com/CaptainErable/Fun-Projects/blob/master/NHL_Arena_List.txt)

- Future objective is to include the schedule of each NHL team and calculate the overall distance that each team travels in a year. 

- End objective is to include conditions similar to those choson by the NHL to optimize team schedules and minimize total travel distance throughout the league.
