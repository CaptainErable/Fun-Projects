Calculation of [average distance between NHL arenas](https://github.com/CaptainErable/Fun-Projects/blob/master/Average%20NHL%20City%20Distance.py) from their [GPS coordinates](https://github.com/CaptainErable/Fun-Projects/blob/master/NHL_Arena_List.txt)

Calculation of the [distance travelled by each team](https://github.com/CaptainErable/Fun-Projects/blob/master/Distance%20Travelled%20by%20NHL%20Teams.py) while taking into account their [schedule](https://github.com/CaptainErable/Fun-Projects/blob/master/NHL_Schedule_19_20.csv)

- Next step would be to implement the different conditions to make a schedule for a team

- Following step would be to rebuild a schedule for each team that would minimize the distance they travel

- End objective would be to include conditions similar to those choson by the NHL to optimize team schedules and minimize total travel distance throughout the league.
